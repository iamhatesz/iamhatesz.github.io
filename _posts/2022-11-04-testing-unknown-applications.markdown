You can find the code and examples from the talk I gave at PyConPL 2022 [here](https://github.com/iamhatesz/pyconpl-2022).

Unfortunately, the video of my talk is still missing on the organizers' YouTube channel.

You can also use the preview below, however you will miss videos and the animated content.
